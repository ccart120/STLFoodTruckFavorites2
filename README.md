# STLFoodTruckFavorites2

<h2>Motivation</h2>
This web app was created as a capstone project for LaunchCode's LiftOff program. It can be time consuming to keep track of popular food 
trucks in St. Louis, and this app will serve to fill that need. It will allow users to find food trucks in common locations in the city. 
Users will be able to search for food trucks in specfic locations on specific dates and save a list of their favorites.

<h2>Technology</h2>
This web app was made using C#/.NET with an MVC model and Entity Framework.
